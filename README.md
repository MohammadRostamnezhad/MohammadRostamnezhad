Hi, I'm Mohammad Rostamnezhad
======
A Junior Front-End Developer exploring the world of modern web creation.
From HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, React, and Next.js to WordPress, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive experiences.
I also have beginner-level experience with PHP, Python, Docker, and SQL.
These days, I’m building my profile piece by piece, learning something new every day, fueled by coffee, music, and my journey with the German language.
Every scroll, every line of code, takes me one step closer to my goals.
